## Description
This is a website designed for use by a college registrar to add students and courses and departments to a database. The user can manage relationships between them, linking students with courses and departments with the help of handy dropdown menus populated with objects from the database. Validation ensures that students cannot be created without association with at least one course and full CRUD functionality is available to all models. Design brought to you by custom css and bootstrap.
